1,1,7,"In my own rating system, a perfect show gets 9/10. If a show strikes me hard emotionally or teach me something that change my life, then it goes another +1. This is a 7/10 show in my mind. Good overall, I may rewatch some episodes but I won't go out of my way to do it.",11
2,1,10,"The second season of Haikyuu!! was truly amazing. I love this anime and it is one of my favourites. The first season ended with a bit of a sad one but the second season is where they pick themselves back up and grow even stronger as a team. It was so intense and yet the humor and comedy that was included just made it perfect. I laughed all the time while watching it. I LOVE this anime and I recommend it to anyone who is into comedic anime with average main characters that are determined to win and are slowly thriving to being the best. They have the ups and downs but thats what makes this anime amazing. If you watch the first episdoe of season one then watch somewhere in season 2, you will see the huge difference between the characters and how they have grown. I'm attached to this anime and it's one anime that I will always love.",11
4,1,7,"This review covers all 3 seasons no spoilers so lets begin the review. The story follows the main character named Hinata, Shouyou he likes to play volleyball but nobody in his middle school played volleyball. When he gets to high school, he joins the volleyball team. He isn't very good because he never played volleyball on an actually team so its your typical underdog story. The story is nothing new and very common story gets a 5. 
 
Now for the art & sound, not bad but not great somewhere in the middle the art & sound gets a 7. Next is the characters the characters are great which is expected from a sports anime. The characters have there own personality and well written the character gets a 8. 
 
Last is my personally enjoyment I really enjoyed watching this anime my personally enjoyment gets a 8. After averaging everything out the score comes to a 7. This is a good anime if you like sport anime but if you don't like sport anime this anime wont change your mind.",11
7,2,3,"***SPOILER WARNING: PLOT ELEMENTS & ENDING REVEALED*** 
 
'Your Lie in April' is quite possibly the most disappointing anime that I have ever seen. This is because the series brings you in with gorgeous visuals, fantastic sound work, an interesting concept and elements of delicious suspense... and then lets you down with horrible story execution, insufferable characters, and an ending which makes you want to go into ""Kyle mode"" and punch a hole through the fucking screen. I really wanted to like this series... but it just wouldn't let me. 
 
To get it out of the way, here is how I rated the show (out of 10): 
Story: 3 
Art: 10 
Sound: 10 
Characters: 2 
Enjoyment: 2 
Overall: *3/10* 
 
I thought about going into detail on everything wrong, and right, about the series, but I think it would be better if I went into the two things that drag this series down into the pits: Kaori, and the ""twist"" ending. 
 
To begin, Kaori is one of the most terrible female MCs I have ever seen: She is selfish, dishonest, manipulative, abusive, self-righteous and histrionic. She spends the entire series forcing Kousei to relive traumatic experiences just so she can get him to play the piano, either as her accompaniment on-stage or simply for her own amusement, all the while leading him on with mixed signals as she is dating his best friend, a popular jock-type who is almost his exact opposite. She constantly belittles him for doing any little thing she doesn't like, hitting him constantly or talking down to him like a misbehaving child. On occasion, she will be incredibly sweet & endearing towards him while they're hanging out... before eventually ditching him abruptly to hang out with her boyfriend. 
 
This all doesn't necessarily make for a poorly-written character, per se, but what makes this all particularly unpleasant is that her bullshit is presented as though it were a good thing for all parties involved! She is framed as some tsundere goddess with a heart of gold when she is actually just a manipulative teenage bitch with a superiority complex. Talk about cognitive dissonance! Had she been portrayed as more damaged and/or morally-ambiguous, which would have been more suited to her actions, the entire series would have been drastically improved as a result, and she would have been, in the end, a far more compelling and even likable character. 
 
Which brings us to the abysmal ""twist"" ending: It turns out that she was in love with Kousei all along and only dated his best friend to get close to him - the titular lie: she likes Watari - claiming that she didn't have the confidence to approach him (which is pure bullshit); however, Kousei doesn't find out about this until he reads it in a note, which she arranged to have delivered to him only after she was already dead. 
 
What. The. Fuck. 
 
So let me get this straight: She spends how many months belittling this poor kid over the agonizing pain he has experienced due to the death of his abusive & overbearing mother by being incredibly abusive herself, playing with his emotions and leading him on the entire time, all while dating a guy she secretly doesn't even like just to subject him to this disgusting behavior... because she was in love with him?! Again: What. The. Fuck. This plot twist and how it was executed instantly made Kaori one of the most unlikable characters imaginable, and ruined what little enjoyment the series could have brought to the table. 
 
Now, had they presented Kaori and/or the revelation differently, this twist could have instantly made her a more compelling, sympathetic & endearing character, and had you looking at her actions in an entirely different light, especially since harboring such love for Kousei would have seemed antithetical to her personality. Instead, we get a boring-yet-infuriating resolution to a mediocre story that leaves you feeling anything but satisfied. 
_______________ 
 
IN SUMMATION: As I said before, this show had a world of potential, and I really did want to like it. I honestly thought it would have everything I wanted in a story like this, and it started out strong enough to make me anticipate the rest of the series... but then it took a watery shit all over my expectations, leaving me annoyed & dissatisfied in the end. Fucking blah.",15
9,14,9,"Most of the time, people says that Japan is a fusion between modernity and tradition, well, maybe that was the foundation of gintama's particular universe...welcome to the Edo period, where strange aliens called Amanto have invaded the Land of samourais. Basically, we follow the daily life of a trio of freelancers that would do everything and anything for money, our three main characters: Sakata Gintoki, a sugar lover, JUMP reader, lazy-perm hair with dead fish eyes; Shinpachi Shimura alias glasses, eternal number 8 in the popularity poll, big supporter of Otsu-chan and the only (almost) serious and rational person in the trio; Kagura, the only female heroine in the shounen jump to ever puke, a walking stomach from the most powerful warrior's tribe: a Yato, and let's not forget their adorable and enormous dog Sadaharu. Due to some unforeseen circumstances these three end up working together and form the Yorozuya Gin-chan.  
 
Well yeah, you would think that with a plot so ordinary and...actually, there isn't really a plot here, is there? Well, many people thought the same exact thing at first, and I am no exception, the only difference is between the people who drop the serie right then and there and those who choose to give it a chance. I was one of the later, and God....thanks, I didn't miss this incredible opportunity.  
 
Gintama is the epitome of unconventionality in so, so many ways. So, let's get it started: 
 
The story: 
 
Well, what can I say, there isn't actually a main story in gintama. Like I said before we follow mainly our trio in their everyday life, however, we discover through the arcs and the meeting with new characters the universe of gintama, how the governement work, the political tension that are hidden in the dark, the involvement of rebels...we also learn through the episodes the backstory of Gintoki, what had made him who he is now, how he had lived before and how he became a mere freelancer. Of course you' ll also learn about the others, and find out things that you didn't expect...yes, it's unpredictable.  
 
Gintama is mainly comedy and parody, so many parody of other anime like bleach, naruto, Death note, jojo bizarre adventure, prince of tennis, DBZ and so on, without trashing them of course. Gintama also makes fun of their own cast, commenting about how they're short on money, about their so-called final arc, fighting about how some characters don't have enough screen-time...well, they just break the fourth wall beautifully, something that we don't see in other anime, and we just enter their world. It also use things of our everyday life and make it so funny to watch, like when you're fighting for food (it turn into a real war), or when you go to the toilet while there is no toilet paper anymore...ouch, have you ever seen a scene revolving around four guys in that situation? Don't think so.  
 
Even if gintama is mainly comedy, the emotional and action part are also enjoyable, with amazing battles with swords, or fists, bringing hype and thrill without dragging it for twenty episodes. The emotional moments and the lessons that we learn, like how sometimes even if we take risk in life or in a battle we may win as much as we may lose, how our true ennemy and the one we need to fight everyday is ourself, our own limits, how the things that are trully important are harder to bear, facing the possibility of losing it anytime. Of course, we still find the theme of power of friendship and team work but with no exagerration, the search of strengh...We also face death and loss (yeah, people die in Gintama, and they don't come back to life by some NAKAMA power crap.), emotional scene, even romance while not being cheesy... 

 
the characters and the main protagonist: 
 
When you think about main character in shounen, most of the time you think of the hero who aim for something and basically the plot revolve around that and how he reachs his goal through different  battles  (in other word, a nekketsu), you see the main hero evolve and grow both mentally and physically. Well, Gintama is...slightly different. First of all, unlike big name like Naruto or One piece, the hero of gintama, Sakata Gintoki, is already an adult which means that he has seen a lot in his life already, and experienced many battles and life lessons, so of course the view point is a little more mature. Gintoki is someone far from being the admirable hero with amazing powers that would blow your mind, truth to be said his only weapon is a mere bokuto, but maybe that is also why he's more relatable since he's closer to reality. Let's face it, none of us is always determinate, there are times when we want to cry, when we want to run away, who actually care about adventures and becoming Hokage? You'd rather be lazy on your couch and pick you nose while reading your new issue of JUMP, right? When you think about it, that's life, real life...nothing really big happen in it, everyday pass by and we're just trying to fight to live for tomorrow, that's our daily life. So yes, you have a main protagonist with nothing extraordinary about him, lazy, and a con man most of the time, but when he needs to, he stands for what he hold dear and even in front of stronger opponent he'd keep on standing firm with conviction, not with the power of his abilities or his sword, but his resolve and very soul. Through the serie he'll teach life lessons to people, things ordinary that we sometimes forgot, and he'll also learn from others, create bonds, and bear more precious burdens that'd make his strenght.  
 
Another thing about gintama's characters, I don't think that there is any one of them that I hate, even those who had a short screen time (they even fight about those by the way), they're all likeable and each of them have their stories and their time to shine, be it the shinsengumi, the forever homeless hasegawa-san alias MADAO, or even the Shogun.  
 
As a woman, I think that this point is truly important. I noticed that most of the time in shounen manga/anime, females characters are most of the time associated with the damsel in distress type, the one that need to be protected and usually is in love with one or the main male protagonist, or the worst, how they are used for fan-service only(I don't think that I need to say which anime I'm referring to). Gintama has many females characters and none of them are considered as weak or as a damsel in distress. They fight and stand at the same level as the males protagonist, get hurt, have their own resolve and reason to stand on the battlefield while never forgetting their femininity as well, and there is no need for exagerrate fan-service bordering hentai.  
 
Overall:
 
Gintama is an anime really complete that has many to offer if you'd give it a chance. Sure, it's long and need a long time to start but still, it's worth it. The comedy may sometimes be hard for those who doesn't understand japanese references but when you do you'll really get your share of laughter. I loved the great life lessons that gintama taught me, especially the way it approach the search of strenght and its meaning in a way different to other shounen, how we don't need to fight stronger opponents in different battles to get stronger but how we have to fight ourselves and our weaknesses, breaking our limits...or how sometimes sacrifice are necessary and how you have to sully your own hands, and most of all, even if you take a risk you have to expect to lose and not get what you're looking for.",12
3,14,7,"Quick summary, read below for more details: 
-Short episodes are amazing 
-Most characters are really good 
-A small set of characters appear very frequently, and most get forgotten 
-Joke explanations get tiring real quickly 
 
Gintama is a series that is, at it's best, a really emotional or absolutely hilarious anime. Because of that it really is a shame, that something with the potential to be this good could end up making me feel tired even before starting an episode. 
 
Gintama is an episodic series, kind of. It's divided by very short arcs, with the longest ones going for around 5 or 6 episodes, and most of them being half or a full episode long. There are arcs that introduce characters, arcs that further the plot and ""filler"" arcs, which are actually the bread and butter of the show. They're often comedic one-offs that set up a funny situation, and end with a great punchline which is often kind of endearing at the same time. 
 
You can see that this kind of approach does not work very well if the runtime is longer, because there is nothing really interesting in the middle. There is a clear setup, but once you understand where it's going, there is usually not really a point in keeping it going for another episode, let alone two or three. (This is the main reason why, in my opinion, the best ""arcs"" are the ones that last half an episode) 
 
But Gintama does this anyway. Now how, one may ask, do they keep rolling a joke about the main characters going to an underwater palace to stop a pervert turtle for 4 episodes? The answer, lies in one of the shows main strengths: it's fantastic roster of characters. 
 
Everyone in this series has a story of their own, and a very well-defined personality (even if that personality is an annoying mess) which makes you think how they would react to different situations and how they get along with different characters. You could say the main focus of Gintama is exploring these relationships, while also taking the audience for a fun ride. 
 
The problem is, as the series stretches and the amount of characters increases, there are some that get forgotten, and some that we want to forget but can't because they are on screen every two episodes. Some have been played to death like MADAO, while others like Sakamoto are barely touched upon. 
 
That's without even mentioning the main way in which Gintama shoots itself in the foot with the ever present joke-explainer character (Usually but not always, Shinpachi). 
 
In comedy, subtlety is king. It's what separates old Simpsons from new Simpsons, it's what makes laugh tracks so damn annoying. If you have to explain a joke, it's usually not that funny. And my grudge with the show is that it's one of the exceptions to that rule of thumb: it's funny despite the explanation... and yet it explains it. 
 
Gintama is obsessed with letting everyone know: ""Hey! I just made a joke! This is the joke right here!"". It's even worse than a laugh track because you don't even have the opportunity to think about what the joke is, they say it right there in front of you. 
 
I'm pretty sure this problem radicates in the fact that, after all is said and done, this is still a show for kids (which is still a condescending attitude, but I can kind-of understand it). The manga probably does a better job in not making Shinpachi so damn annoying by shouting things mid-sentence because you can stop reading his dialogue, but that doesn't fly in anime. 
 
I'm pretty sure that if you cut out most of Shinpachi's lines, the show would have a much better flow and would be much funnier. Though that would leave too much time that the episode would need to fill- wait, that sounds familiar... 
 
That's right, my old point: the best episodes are the half-episodes. They are the most densely packed, fast-paced, joke-explanation-free episodes out there. These are the ones that remind me why I love Gintama in the first place. I just wish more of them were like this. But as the series stretches more and more, these episodes become less frequent.",12
8,14,10,"AWESOME HAS A NEW NAME AND THAT'S GINTAMA 
Gintama is the best action-com i have ever seen!  
when you see too many shonen anime one or the other day you will get exausted and that is the time when gintama opens the door of a world where only eccentric characters live. 

It is the best ANTI-SHONEN OUT THERE by anti shonen  i am saying that it does something which any shonen can never do but still remains in the boundry of shonen  genere 
 
when i first saw the ep of gintama i was thinking that yes it has a great humor but why do everybody rate it so high after seeing 10 ep i was thinking of droping the series but when the story progresses it will be a memorable exp. and the bar gets higher and higher with se2 and se3   
 
IT IS A VERY VERY GREAT ANIME DO NOT DROP IT AT ANY POINT",13
5,14,8,"The great thing about Gintama is that it is not limited by anything. It tells the story of a jack of all trades in a sci-fi setting, meaning that there are no boundaries as to where the story can go or what can happen to the characters. As pointed out by Gin-san himself, 'In this world it's never a strange thing to have your manhood crushed or switched out for a screwdriver'. 
 
The show may seem dull to begin with, but this is simply the downside to having such an open premise. As soon as all the main characters and their traits are established the quality of the comedy improves. The depth of the main characters and perhaps the frequent basis on which the manga is serialised means that little effort is put into guest characters and their character development. The unfortunate result is the occasional extremely boring arcs with cliche villains and half-assed plot. Although these arcs are sometimes painful to watch, they have their moments and I think they were ploys by the author to buy enough time to come up with even funnier adventures for the main gang.  
 
No other anime exploits the fact that it is an animation better than Gintama. Breaking the fourth wall is entertaining in anime no matter what, but Gintama takes this to the next level by integrating it into the plot. Similarly, the culture references are bravely used as hilarious plot twists, making the parody aspect of Gintama more than just fan service. Gintama is even able to use the limitations of a low budget to its advantage; some of my favourite scenes are voice acting over background only. Gintama also has its touching scenes, where the poetic cheese is great and wraps up an episode well. All these things combined with the brilliant voice acting makes Gintama a completely unique form of comedy and, in my opinion, the most watchable anime there is.",16
6,6,8,"The second season of Mob Psycho pursues Mob's growth as a character as he faces individuals plagued by Esper powers. He learns to become independent from Reigan and seeks to help others with similar powers as him, and along the way establish purpose in his own life as he progresses through his Middle School years. 
 
The first half of Mob Psycho consists of comedic slife-of-life with the occasional action-packed fight scenes. Mob himself has undergone substantial growth throughout, constantly pushing himself and restraining from using his powers so as to help him learn to not become too reliant on it. His personality is as awkward as ever, which is the main charm I have always seen him have. His development as a character is solid and engaging, his inner conflicts captivitating the viewer as he struggles to blend into society while helping individuals along the way. 
 
Even Reigen goes through substantial growth as a character as he steps back and reconsiders his recent decisions. His encounter with Mob, his current spirit business, and if his whole ordeal ever had a purpose. Through this realisation he becomes aware of his actions and begins to develop his friendship with Mob, aiming to act as a reliable Master.  
 
The second half folds into one huge arc concerning Sho Suzuki's father. His father seeks to rule the world, changing it to fit his own views based on his Psychic powers. There are multiple fights animated consistently, providing fun action, though the final boss fight is rather short-lived. Nevertheless, the story is the focus here, and Touichiro Suzuki and Mob learn from each other because of their two vastly opposing views on the world. Even the villains here learn something in the end. 
 
Speaking of which, the villains are not exactly that special yet still show enough depth as they learn from Mob's character. Taking the same approach as the first season, the antagonists are shown to be extremely powerful, becoming even stronger than last season's foes. Unfortunately for them, Mob prevails in the end, showing almost no effort to best them, only being restrained by his moral conviction of peace instead of violence. Some have actually reformed, as shown with one of the Upper Claw division's decision to fight alongside Reigen and Mob. Others have found their way through the rubble, reconsidering their attempts of dominating the world, and realising there may be better ways of using their powers. 
 
The animation looks to be a step down from the previous season. Though the action is as enjoyable and exciting as ever, it is rather short-lived, with the only real highlight in Mob's confrontation with Mogami Keiji. Backgrounds look unimpressive with very little detail. Still though, it is consistent enough to support the weight of its hype. 
 
The journey with Kageyama-kun and his friends has been a good one so far. Each episode pulls me in with endearing protagonists, pumping action, and a well-written story with a message that can apply to anyone. Live life to the fullest. No matter who you are, your social standing, your place in society, you contribute to the world in one way or another. I'm satisfied.",17
