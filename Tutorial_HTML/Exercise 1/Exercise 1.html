            About H2 Computing
        </h2>
        <p>
            We use Python as our main language in this subject.
        
            <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Here is a link to the official Python Website</a>

            Here are 3 reasons H2 Computing is cool:

                1. It's useful and practical.

                2. There are a lot of interesting questions.

                3. We can build authentic real-life applications.
